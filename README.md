Sometimes it's best to directly control the digital pins on the Arduino for speed and simultaneous switching - something than cannot be done using DigitalWrite. 

The same can be said for ensuring your code runs as fast as it can, with no overheads that would be introduced when your code is optimised for size.
Here I show you a couple of techniques that are easy to implement directly into your sketch.

The complete list of GCC compiler optimisations - use with great care!
